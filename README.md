# Rock paper scissors game

Php console implementation of rock paper scissors game

## Implementation notes

**This implementation of the game allows extra functionality 
for any number of layers and any number of move options.
For example, besides classic game, there is config for 3 players 
and 5 move options (with extra Spock and Lizard move options).**

You can run 3 players Spock / Lizard config with

    make run-spock-lizard

### Score system description for more than 2 players
To allow more than 2 players, this game uses player score idea - when player beats competitor,
his score is incremented. Game ranking is implemented by grouping players by score and sort by highest score.

Several players could have the same rank if they have equal score.
For example, if 2 players of 3 have the highest rank, they both get the 1st place, while the least player gets 2nd place.
If all 3 players have the same score - it's a Draw.
